[Task 3] Final stage 


lets login to the RDP{}
to do this we use Remmina Application

we will use Solomon Grundy as SG
and from task 1 possible password

username : SG
password : UmbracoIsTheBest!

we got logedin, on the desktop there is a text file user
and found our user flag

THM{N00T_NO0T}																		//user flag


by showing all hidden files
we can see some hidden files and folders inside c:/
there is hidden backup folder and a file called restore

we cant open the file but we cant open it, because of permission 
we can edit the permissions on it. Simply add yourself (username) to the permissions tab,
therefore allowing yourself to access the file. 
Finally, open it up and read the password.

file has password : ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime


now logout the corrent RDP session and login as 
username : Administrator
password : ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime

and finelly we get the root flag on desktop

THM{Y0U_4R3_1337}																	//root flag
